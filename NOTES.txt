NOTES:

General TOC:
- Some high-level presentation of the concepts
	- processes
	- filesystems
	- virtualization
	- OS level-virtualization
- The concrete technical presentation
- General Use-Cases
- Freescale Use-Cases
	- some details about Freescale processors and what they are running

Concrete technical presentation will focus on:
- the DEMO
- the graphical presentation of the DEMO
- the benchmarking results
TOTAL: 10 pages

Improved security
- increased uptime
- fast recovery
- data replication
Downside:
- lower performance
- app partial isolation

Barbecue analogy:
- barbecue - host (machine)
- people - users
- fry meat - use services
- heat up the whole barbecue just to fry a small piece of meat
- sharing the barbecue - smell mixing, meat stealing
- CPU - ember temperature
- memeory - surface
- peripherals - side placement for prepared meat?
- I/O - raw meat in, fried meat out

Poza cu cgroups - exemplu cu memoria
- graf pe tabla - insista ca graful nu se refera la procese, ci la partitionarea unei resurse

DEMO:
- start 2 containers - and make them all run on one processor - assuming you have a multicore host
- give them 75% - 25% CPU - make them all run intensive processing
