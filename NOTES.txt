- Freescale Use-Cases

Concrete technical presentation will focus on:
- the DEMO
- the graphical presentation of the DEMO
- the benchmarking results

SO Concepts:
- processes
- filesystems

Freescale:


DEMO:
- start 3 containers - and make them all run on one processor - assuming you have a multicore host
- give them 50% - 25% - 25% CPU - make them all run intensive processing
